<h2>Introduction</h2>

ABC Consulting is a group of consultants helping consumers choose the best area in Calgary to reside based on their preferences.

Calgary is one of the fastest growing technology, finance, logistical, and film industry hubs in the country. Recently, top companies such as Amazon, Infosys, and RBC have announced their new expansions and investments into the city. In addition, American TV companies like HBO have chosen Calgary to film major scenes among different shows. With that being said, changes in technology and how people use real estate has significantly disrupted the changing industry we see today. Leaders today are focused on client experience, harnessing the power of data and technology to help fulfill their personal and business needs. With COVID-19, many others are also moving to remote work, which allows a large group of people to be more particular in regards to where they choose to live. The changing landscape we see in Calgary makes this city a desirable place to live, which is why our firm strives to help people find the best place of residence in the city and choose top investment real estate properties based on their needs.





<h2>Strategic Methodologies</h2>

Helping Calgarians choose their dream home involves helping our clients make better investment decisions based on a number of factors. Some may prefer to choose a place of residence based on market trends, others may choose based on personal preference such as family-first neighborhoods. In order for ABC Consulting to properly provide guidance on homes, decisions need to be data-driven. In order to achieve this, a number of factors such as crime rate, school ratings, property assessment, and many others need to be further investigated.
